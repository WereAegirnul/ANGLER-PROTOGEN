# ANGLER-PROTOGEN
Thailand's (Technically also Japan's?) first (hopefully) Open Source Protogen Base... from scratch.

Features Slip-in frame for ESP32 LED 64x32 Matrix, a mount for 4010 Fan, divided electronics part that can be taken of in one go (including the matrix, board, and the 'headphones' all in one part), a visor thermoform base and some other stuff that I haven't really got a name for.

This Repo is for people to edit the model to fit their tastes, or maybe just use this for like, whatever- it may be a bit wonky, but I'm still learning.

There will be updates of this model- this is the 1.0 Version of the ANGLER-PROTOGEN. Addons will be put in another folder, if there is one.

I will post this on Printables at a later date if the the 1.X version is complete with multiple revisions.

I don't know why I named it Angler-Protogen though. Sounds cool.

# Disclaimer for those who's printing this model
This model, is made for my Voron 2.4 (35x35x33 cm) to print it all in one go for each object. If it's too big for you, I recommend using PrusaSlicer or any other Slicer programs to cut the pieces.

This model MAY be non-mandifold. I used Boolean too many times, and one of the objects had to be Voxel Remeshed. If done editing, I would recommend voxel remeshing the finished product or fix it through Netfabb.

This is THE BASE MODEL- and you are free to edit it or leave it be.

There are TWO versions of this, Tri and Quad. Quad will have a gap on the nose, giving more visibility while the Tri has a closed end. 

# Additional Files
There are bases for you to plan out your Protogen, and can be used to design a premade or envision you or your client's suit in a blueprint-like style.
